Install IPFS
IPFS is a collection of protocols, packages, and specifications that allow computers to send and receive data. Because of this, users can pick and choose which packages to install when using IPFS. And like shoe sizes, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. A developer building network applications will install a different set of tools to someone who just wants to store files on IPFS. Pick the one that best suits what you're here to do:

#File storage
Anyone can use IPFS to store files in a decentralized way. The easiest way to get up and running is by installing the IPFS Desktop application. This app has Go-IPFS built-in and lets you interact with the network through a simple user-interface. Check it out →

#Application development
Want to build decentralized applications and store your application data on IPFS? You'll likely want to install the command-line version of IPFS. There's no GUI to deal with, just raw input and output through your terminal. Find out more →

#IPFS as infrastructure
Planning to set up several IPFS nodes within one network? You'll want to take a look at installing IPFS Cluster →

#Surf the decentralized web
Not many browsers come with IPFS built-in, unfortunately. But, you can install an IPFS companion extension that will let you view decentralized web content! Learn more →
